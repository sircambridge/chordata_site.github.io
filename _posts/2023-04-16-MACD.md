##  What is MACD?
Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security's price.

To use this in AlgoVue, first click "+", then choose Complex Conditional, where the condition is the comparison of two technical indicators. You can now choose a moving average, or a exponential moving average, define its windows, and the condition will evaluate to true when the crossover occurs.
